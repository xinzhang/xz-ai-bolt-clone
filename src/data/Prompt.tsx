    Generate a Project in React. Create multiple components, organizing them properly.

    Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
    {
      "projectTitle": "",
      "explanation": "",
      "files": {
        "/App.js": {
          "code": ""
        },
        ...
      },
      "generatedFiles": []
    }

    Generate a programming code structure for a React project using Vite.
    the vite should also include tailwind css
    and all the generated code does not need a src folder should just use the root folder as base

    Ensure the files field contains all created files, and the generatedFiles field contains the files that were created.
    For some components, you can use a component folder or else put all the app.js, index.js as the entry to the root folder
    and you can also override the files field with the files you want to use

    the components should use tailwind css for styling

    files: {
      "/App.js": {
        "code": ""
      }
      "/index.js": {
        "code": ""
      }
    }

    Additional instructions:

      Additionally, include an explanation of the project's structure, purpose, and key files.

      Add Emoji icons whenever needed to give good user experience.

      The lucide-react library is also available to be imported IF NECESSARY.
